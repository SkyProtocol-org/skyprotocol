# Sky Protocol Project Catalyst Milestone 3

## Abstract

This document describes the achievement of the acceptance criteria for Milestone 3.

## Acceptance criteria

Reference: https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1200203/milestones/3

### Criterium 1

[quote]
The deliverable is all about extending the previous one to
support more decentralization in the DA service roughly
corresponding to sections 1)b) and 1)c) of the specification from
Milestone 1. All other details are subordinate to the implementation
and validation of this support for decentralization.

This deliverable extends the previous Milestone 2 with support for
multi-signatures instead of just single signatures (criterium 3,
below), updating the committee signatures (criterium 4), and
delegation of topics to subordinate committees (criterium 5).

### Criterium 2

[quote]
Again, the smart contracts should build, and the tests shall
pass at the specified commit, run against a private Cardano
network, and execute the on-chain smart contract flows of a Data
Availability interaction including bridge updates and client
validations.

The tests, below, run on the Yaci Devkit, available at
link:https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-devkit[].

### Criterium 3

[quote]
The smart contracts should accept multisigs against a varying
set of public keys, rather than a simple signature against a fixed
public key.

The contracts now use simple multi-signatures made up of lists of
single signatures, see link:../src/SkyBridgeContract.hs[].

```
data PubKey = PubKey PlutusTx.BuiltinByteString
data MultiSigPubKey = MultiSigPubKey [PubKey] Integer
data SingleSig = SingleSig PubKey PlutusTx.BuiltinByteString
```

### Criterium 4

[quote]
The bridge contract should be able to follow a chain of committees.

The file link:test-bridge.sh[], described in more detail below,
demonstrates updating the top hash stored in the bridge NFT, thereby
updating the committee multisig pubkey.

### Criterium 5

[quote]
The client contract should be able to verify an attestation wherein
data was accepted by a topic committee itself attested by the main DA
committee.

The file link:test-bounty.sh[], described in more detail below,
demonstrates offering and claiming a bounty for a message hash
attested by a topic committee itself attested by the main committee.

## Contracts Overview (Repeated from Milestone 2)

The general idea is that the bridge NFT contains a hash, called the
_top hash_ of both the root hash of the DA merkle tree as well as the
fingerprint of the data providers' committee multisig.

Updating the top hash requires supplying a signature by the DA committee.

A client contract may depend on the top hash by using the bridge NFT
as a CIP-31 reference input.

An example of a client contract is a so-called bounty contract, which
locks some funds, and pays them out if a claimant can prove that a
particular datum is stored in the DA merkle tree.

The claimant does this by supplying a merkle proof of data inclusion,
as well as the fingerprint of the current committee multisig.

In our example, the bounty prize will be paid out if the claimant can
prove that a datum with the hash `0xCAFE` is stored in the DA network.
(Our system supports hashes of any length, we just use such a simple
one for this test for memorability).

# Testing the contracts

Requirements: Debian/Ubuntu Linux box.

## Setup

Setting up requires the following steps:

### Step 1: Install dependencies and generate keys (link:pre-setup.sh[])

```
./pre-setup.sh
```

### Step 2: Manual configuration

#### Step 2.1: Configure Yaci Devkit

In the devkit directory, run:

```
sudo ./bin/devkit.sh start
```

In the Yaci CLI, run:

```
yaci-cli:>create-node -o --start
```

#### Step 2.2: Get funds from testnet faucet

Find the admin address:

```
cat var/admin.addr
```

In the Yaci CLI, run:

```
yaci-cli:>topup <admin-address> 10000
```

### Step 3: Finalize setup (link:post-setup.sh[])

```
./post-setup.sh
```

## Test: Offering and Claiming a Bounty (link:test-bounty.sh[])

```
./test-bounty.sh
```

This test demonstrates offering a bounty that will be paid out if a
claimant can demonstrate that a particular message hash is stored
under a particular topic ID in the merkle tree by providing a merkle
proof.

Specifically, the topic ID must be `0x00` and the message hash must be
`0xCAFE`.  These parameters are set when the bounty contract is
created with link:../app/GenBountyBlueprint.hs[].

This uses the files:

* link:offer-bounty.mjs[] to lock some funds at the bounty contract.
  This is a very simple script that simply sends Ada to the bounty contract.

* link:verify-bounty-offered.mjs[] to verify that some funds are locked at the contract.
  Another simple script that verifies that there are indeed Ada at the contract.

* link:claim-bounty.mjs[] to claim the bounty (i.e. unlock the locked funds).
  This is the main part of the test.

* link:verify-bounty-claimed.mjs[] to verify that the locked funds have be claimed.

The following data is sent from the off-chain script
link:claim-bounty.mjs[] to the on-chain bounty contract.  See
link:../test/Spec/SkySpec.hs[] for the construction of these hashes.

The redeemer proves inclusion of the hash `0xCAFE` in the topic and
inclusion of the topic ID in the DA, and includes the main and topic committee fingerprints.

```
// ClaimBounty redeemer
const redeemer = {
    alternative: 0,
    fields: [
	// messageInTopicProof :: SimplifiedMerkleProof
	{ alternative: 0,
	  fields: [
	      // DataHash
	      { alternative: 0, fields: [ "CAFE" ] },
	      // DataHash
	      { alternative: 0, fields: [ "BABE" ] }
	  ]
	},
	// topicInDAProof :: SimplifiedMerkleProof
	{ alternative: 0,
	  fields: [
	      // DataHash
	      { alternative: 0, fields: [ "5c82f057ac60bbc4c347d15418960d453468ffa2b6f8b2e0041d0cad3453f67f" ] }, // topic 1 top hash
	      // DataHash
	      { alternative: 0, fields: [ "0000" ] } // topic 2 top hash
	  ]
	},
	// topicCommitteeFingerprint :: DataHash
	{ alternative: 0, fields: [ "b25f003443ff6eb36a6baafaf5bc5d5e78c1dbd4533e3c49be498f23a9ac5767" ] }, // topic 1 committee fp
	// mainCommitteeFingerprint :: DataHash
	{ alternative: 0, fields: [ "5470fbfd926cdaa4ffc4d9d186670b37c35a3055875fbcaac403d0a3cf86df9f" ] } // main committee fingerprint
    ]
}
```

## Test: Updating the Bridge (link:test-bridge.sh[])

```
./test-bridge.sh
```

This test demonstrates updating the bridge UTXO NFT with a different
top hash, and verifying (by querying the blockchain) afterwards that
the update has indeed happened.

This uses the files:

* link:update-bridge.mjs[] to update the bridge NFT

* link:verify-bridge.mjs[] to verify the bridge NFT's current value

Updating the bridge (link:update-bridge.mjs[]) sends the following
data to the bridge contract.  Again, see link:../test/Spec/SkySpec.hs[] for
the construction of these hashes.

The redeemer proves that the new top hash is signed by the main committee.

```
// UpdateBridge redeemer
const redeemer = {
    alternative: 0,
    fields: [
        // bridgeCommittee :: MultiSigPubKey
	{
 	    alternative: 0,
            fields: [
                [
          	     mkPubKey("3363A313E34CF6D3B9E0CE44AED5A54567C4302B873DD69EC7F37B9E83AABF65"),
		     mkPubKey("42FB07466D301CA2CC2EFF2FD93A67EB1EBBEC213E6532A04DC82BE6A41329AE"),
		     mkPubKey("22B9524D37A16C945DEEC3455D92A1EBC5AC857174F5A0A8B376517A205DCA73")
                ]
                2 // Number of public keys that must sign
            ]
        },
	// bridgeOldRootHash :: DataHash
	mkDataHash("9f06268167a61b7f54210ebcd0a92d9000211a41401f7827b5bf905b8fd3e263"), // main root hash 1
	// bridgeNewTopHash :: DataHash
	mkDataHash("3c7dfafe47aac5454629d9280529b90b82d07ba80b89757d652bff047f0534a1"), // top hash 2
	// bridgeSig :: MultiSig
	{
            alternative: 0,
            fields: [
	    	[ { alternative: 0, // top hash 2 sig 1
	    	    fields: [ pk1, "87E894C503E40A8CB98DEB8618DC068323092871C717D4781D56FCBBE10FCD6B1965ADE766FFDFAF8F7B2964F3ED8A6066703DD9AA68F583055ED53FBA27A90E" ] },
                  { alternative: 0, // top hash 2 sig 2
                    fields: [ pk2, "99E3BBBCA63ECDA27ADC6ED426A695E32AA5D7185CFC16F550834919C96F7FA17E19992E6FB2D302BE8FF71CF71907F654F25727425C0F30989B4AAC7767B003" ] }
                ]
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
